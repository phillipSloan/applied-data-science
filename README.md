### NaN Values in Diagnosis Variables <a name="nan-in-diag"></a>

Heatmap of the four diagnosis variables: has_dep_diag, dep_score, dep_thoughts, secd_diag.
NaN entries represented as 0 (dark) and not NaN entries represented as 1 (bright). 
The lines show that there are rows of missing values across all four diagnosis variables. 
The variable with the least data is dep_thoughts, the other three diagnosis variables have almost equal amounts of data.
